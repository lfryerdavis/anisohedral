# anisohedral
This is a project to find anisohedral criteria for polyforms.

## Background

Empirically, most isohedral tilings satisfy Conway's Criterion using the tiles' boundary. However, to the author's knowledge, there is no corresponding criteria for anisohedral tilings. This work is a first step in finding anisohedral tiling criteria for polyforms. By using the topological equivalence between the Laves tilings and isohedral tilings, we set up a method to extract equivalent anisohedral topologies. This will then be compared with equivalent boundary words to determine criteria for anisohedral tilings.

## Installing the Software

You will need to download the software for the ear cutting triangulation algorithm at [https://github.com/mapbox/earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp). This is just one header file.

You will have to ensure that the header file is downloaded into the same directory as the anisohedral software or modify the makefile appropriately. 

The makefile for the anisohedral software (located at `src/Makefile`) is currently set up for a default C++20 configuration for macOS Sequoia 15.6. It is not configured for any specific IDE. If you have a different setup, you may need to make minor changes to the Makefile. 

## Software Guide
The simplest set of options is to see the boundaries of all the shapes that are going to be used in the project.

```
./anisohedral -laves -tests -boundaryonly -o boundaries.tex -showneighbours -standalone
```
The `-o` option is used to specify the output. The default name is `out.tex`. In this case, the file is called `boundaries.tex`.

The `-laves` option shows a representative of all Laves tiles. These tiles can also be generated using single options such as `-hex`, `-floretleft`, and so on. The different options are found in the `anisohedral.cpp` file.

The `-tests` option shows a representative of all the test tiles. These tiles can also be generated using single options. The test anchor tiles all have a different placement of knots (identified by blue circles instead of black circles) to ensure that the anchor placement code is working correctly. The different options are found in the `anisohedral.cpp` file.

The `-boundaryonly` option will only show the boundary of the generated tiles. There will be no tile splits.

For the Laves tilings, the tiles can have the neighbours generated using the `-showneighbours` option. This will be used to count the vertex degree of each tile using the boundaries when extracting the tile topologies.

The `-standalone` option is used to have a standalone TikZ file instead of a regular LaTeX file. This will probably be what you want, to allow the copy and paste of the standalone TikZ code into a LaTeX file, or to copy the compiled picture into other files. The regular LaTeX file will not be scaled, so the output will often not fit into a page if you are not using the `-standalone` option.

To create splits of an arbitrary depth, a command similar to the following is used.
```
./anisohedral -debug 1 -laves -o lavesdepth2.tex -standalone -depth 2
```

The `-depth` option specifies how deep in the recursion you wish to go. There were a total of 3,914,597 shapes generated by this command. To assist with debugging, there is a `-debug` option, where 0 (the default) gives no output, and 3 gives a lot of output. Each file in the code has its own set of debug variables to control the amount of debug output while programming. When the `-depth` is non-zero, only one random image is generated for each root tile to cut down on the output. A sample run is in the `/results` directory of the repository, and some of the generated pictures are shown below.
